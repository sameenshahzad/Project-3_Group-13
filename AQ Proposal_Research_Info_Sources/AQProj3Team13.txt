RESEARCH QUESTION:

How dangerous is air pollution and what are its effects on health?

What is air pollution?

It is the presence of harmful substances in the air that we breathe. These substances can be in the form of gases, particles, or biological molecules 

that can have harmful effects on human health, animals, and the environment.

According to WHO, Air pollution is a major and pressing public health threat. WHO estimates that around 7 million people die every year 

from exposure to fine particles in polluted air that lead to diseases such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases 

and respiratory infections, including pneumonia. Pollutants include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. 

Both ambient (outdoor) and household (indoor) air pollution are harmful for health (https://www.who.int/india/health-topics/air-pollution#:~:
text=Air%20pollution%20is%20a%20major,and%20respiratory%20infections%2C%20including%20pneumonia).

Scope:

The scope of the study is to examine the extent of air pollution in a specific geographical area, the sources of pollution, 

and its impact on human health. This study focuses on a specific type of air pollutant or a combination of pollutants.

Purpose:

The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the health risks associated with exposure to air pollution. 

The study aims to answer the research question by collecting and analyzing data on the concentration of pollutants 

and the associated health outcomes. The results of the study could be used to inform public policy and guide interventions to reduce air pollution 

and improve public health. Additionally, the study could help to identify populations that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution,
 
such as children, elderly people, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.



DATA EXPLORATION


What information does this website provide? 

https://www.iqair.com/air-pollution-data-api

The website https://www.iqair.com/air-pollution-data-api provides information about the AirVisual API, a platform developed by IQAir 

that provides real-time air quality data for thousands of locations around the world. The API allows developers to access this data and 

integrate it into their own applications or websites.

The website provides information about the features of the AirVisual API, including the types of data that can be accessed, the API endpoints, 

and the data formats supported. It also provides documentation on how to use the API, including sample code snippets and guides for various
 
programming languages.

In addition to the technical documentation, the website also provides information about the benefits of using the AirVisual API, including the ability 

to provide accurate and up-to-date air quality information to users, and the potential to raise awareness about the health effects of air pollution.

Overall, the website is primarily targeted towards developers who want to use the AirVisual API to access air quality data for their own applications.
