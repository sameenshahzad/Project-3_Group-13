Purpose:


The purpose of this study is to investigate the health impacts and mortality risk of air pollution, including ambient household air pollution, ambient particulate matter pollution, ambient ozone pollution, and air pollution caused by solid fuels. By examining exposure to these types of pollution, we aim to gain a better understanding of the risks associated with air pollution and identify potential strategies to mitigate its harmful effects on human health.

Scope:


The study covers a period of 5 years (2015-2019) and includes data on air quality, mortality rates, and disease burden associated with air pollution from a variety of countries. The focus is on the health impacts and mortality risk associated with exposure to ambient household air pollution, ambient particulate matter pollution, ambient ozone pollution, and air pollution caused by solid fuels.


Limitations:


The study is limited by the availability and quality of data, which may vary by country and over time. In addition, the study focuses on selected types of air pollution and does not cover all possible sources of air pollution, such as industrial emissions or transportation-related pollution.



Overview:


The study involves analyzing air quality data from different countries as well as mortality rate and disease burden data related to air pollution. We used modeling technique like interactive vivisualizations to present the spatial distribution of pollutants such as PM25, PM10, and NO2 their ambient concentrations across different countries, quantifying air pollution,burden of disease and mortality rates. These pollutants, in addition to other pollutants vary across the globe and may result in different concentrations of air pollution  country to country.


Conclusions:

Pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 allow scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of their ambient concentrations across different countries, quantifying air pollution,burden of disease and mortality rates. These pollutants, in addition to other pollutants vary across the globe and may result in different concentrations of air pollution from city to city, and country to country.

Based on our analysis, it can be concluded that air pollution is among the top five factors contributing to mortality rates and burden of disease worldwide.

It can be deduced that similar age groups (i.e., under 5, 5-14, 15-49, 50-69, 70 plus) are affected similarly by air pollution in all countries across the globe.

Understanding the severity of air pollution and the burden of disease and mortality rates related to it is important for public health officials, policymakers, and healthcare providers, as it can help them to prioritize resources and develop interventions to reduce the impact of the disease on the population.
