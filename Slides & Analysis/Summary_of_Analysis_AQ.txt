The data were analysed using rank method (top 10 countries) to compare the air quality of different countries by 
the amount of concentration of air pollutant PM 2.5, PM10 and N02  and the combination of all these pollutants by country and by year

The death rate by age group were ranked by the highest number of mortality rates (standardized rate, per 100 000 poppulation) by country and by year

The death rate from different types of air pollution like 'household_air_pollution_deaths','ambient_particulate_matter_pollution_deaths', 'air_pollution_deaths',
'ambient_ozone_pollution_deaths were ranked to top 10 countries with the highest rate by year and by country

The disease burden by risk factors were ranked from highest to lowest according to risk factor DALYs rate air pollution stands.

The  number of deaths by risk factor were ranked according to risk factor mortality rate to compare where air pollution stands

The pollution mortality data were ranked in descending order to compare which type of pollution has the highest number of deaths.
